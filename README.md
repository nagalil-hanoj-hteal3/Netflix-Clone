## üîß Setup and Configuration
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trailo-hub.git
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
   npm install
   npm install --prefix frontend
3. Setup .env file:
    ```bash
    PORT = your port number
    MONGO_URI = your mongo uri
    NODE_ENV = your env
    JWT_SECRET = your jwt secret
    TMDB_API_KEY = your the movie database api key
4. Run the application:
    ```shell
    npm run build
    npm run start
## üõ† Additional Customizations
<p>This project includes custom features that go beyond the original tutorial:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Strategy Design Pattern:</b> Differentiates movies and TV shows based on API response to ensure correct categorization.</li>
  <li><b>Detailed Reviews:</b> Pulls and displays user critiques for movies and shows from the TMDB database.</li>

  <li><b>Expanded Search and Discovery:</b> Implemented advanced filtering, collections browsing, and dedicated person pages.</li>
  <li><b>Multi-dimensional Content Exploration:</b> Enhanced pages for movies, TV shows, actors, and trending content.</li>
</ol>

## üíª Local Development
<p>Open TWO terminals...</p>
<p>To start the development server, run this on the root: </p>

```bash
npm run dev
```
<p>To run the frontend react, run this on the shell: </p>

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm run dev
```
## üåê Deployment
<p>This project is hosted on Render (as provided on the link), making it sufficient and easy to deploy both frontend and backend. Simply connect with a repository, set environment variables in Render's dashboard and deploy. Any changes pushed in the repository will automatically redeploy the web service for FREE!</p>

## üìà Benefits
<ul>
  <li><b>Comprehensive Feature Set:</b> The app includes a variety of functionalities, such as advanced search filters, cast details, bookmarking, and actor information, offering users a more complete content browsing experience.</li>
  <li><b>Responsive and User-Friendly Design:</b> Tailwind CSS provides a sleek, mobile-friendly interface that looks good on all devices.</li>
  <li><b>Efficient State Management:</b> With the strategy design pattern, the app distinguishes between movies and TV shows more efficiently, leading to more organized code and better separation of concerns.</li>
  <li><b>Rich Movie and TV Show Data:</b> Integration with TMDB allows users to view detailed movie and TV show information, including reviews, cast members, and image galleries.</li>
  <li><b>Advanced Search and Discovery:</b> Collections browsing, trending pages, and comprehensive search filters help users explore content more effectively.</li>
  <li><b>Personalization Features:</b> Bookmarking and recommended content based on user selections enhance user engagement.</li>
  <li><b>Secure Authentication:</b> JWT-based authentication ensures secure login sessions, keeping user data private.</li>
  <li><b>Extendable Architecture:</b> The use of patterns and modular code makes it easy to add new features or adapt the codebase to other APIs or functionality in the future.</li>
</ul>

## üìâ Drawbacks
<ul>
  <li><b>Limited Scalability with TMDB API:</b> Reliance on the TMDB API means the app is constrained by TMDB's rate limits and data availability. For high-traffic scenarios, this may require additional caching or a move to a custom database.</li>
  <li><b>Limited User Interaction:</b> While bookmarking is added, more advanced user interactions like ratings or comments are not fully supported.</li>
  <li><b>Single-Server Dependency:</b> The app is hosted on Render as a single backend and frontend instance. For larger user bases, a microservices architecture with separate backend and frontend deployments might be necessary.</li>
  <li><b>No Offline Mode:</b> The app currently requires an active internet connection, as there is no caching or offline data storage implemented.</li>
</ul>
